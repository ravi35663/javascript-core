    <!-- Why script srces are bottom of the body tag? -->
    <!-- 
        As a result, if the js file needed to extract information from 
        either of the trees (DOM and CSS object model), it would not have 
        enough information. Therefore, script srces are generally at the 
        end of the body where most of the trees have already been rendered.
